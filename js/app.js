// Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.

// Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random

// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.

// Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.

// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.

// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

function Location(cookiesPerCust, maxHourCust, minHourCust) {
  this.cookiesPerCust = cookiesPerCust;
  this.maxHourCust = maxHourCust;
  this.minHourCust = minHourCust;
  function randCustPerHour(){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxHourCust - minHourCust) + minHourCust);
  }
  this.cookiesPerHour = randCustPerHour() * cookiesPerCust;
  

}
